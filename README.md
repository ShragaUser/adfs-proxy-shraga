# [Shraga](https://shragauser.github.io/adfs-proxy-shraga/)

Shraga is a saml authentication proxy.

Technology Stack:

- SAML
- passport.js
- JWT
- Express.js

---

- **What:** Shraga makes it painless to authenticate applications over saml protocol.
  It standardizes the user profile returned from the saml-idp by following this [schema](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-smarr-vcarddav-portable-contacts-00).
  Additionally it allows enriching the user`s profile from other services before returning to your applications.

---

- **Why:** Prevents from reconfiguring your apps directly in the ADFS or the saml-idp over and over for every app, and provides a centrelized standardized "idp-proxy", and dealing with metadata.xml or relying party.

---

- **How:** Instead of configuring the authentication directly to your app you forward to adfs-proxy and after the user is authenticated he is redirected back to adfs-proxy and a JWT is returned to your app.

---

## Setup

---

#### Dependencies:

- ADFS must be enabled and running. in development a sample SAML-idp can be used - [saml-idp docker](https://github.com/kristophjunge/docker-test-saml-idp).
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance must be provided via .env or docker-compose variables ( for session management)

---

#### Easy-Setup:

use image based docker-compose that creates a Plug-and-Play saml-idp and the adfs-proxy (Shraga) on a single container.

```
cd  ./compose
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```

---

#### Manual-Setup:

you must connect Shraga to a SAML-IDP. this can be an Enterprise ADFS in an inside organization or via a local development saml-idp as shown in the dependecies doc.

---

#### Docker:

```
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```

change environment variables in the docker-compose.yml to your needs.

---

#### Local:

create .env file containing the following configurations

if no .env file exists default values will be used.

```
# MongoDB is required for session management
MONGODB_URL
MONGODB_NAME

# important - can be any value
SESSION_SECRET

# for ADFS only:
SAML_ENTRY_POINT
SAML_ISSUER
SAML_CALLBACK_URL

# for ADFS claims:
# the names of the claims returned by the ADFS
PROFILE_EXTRACTOR_ID
PROFILE_EXTRACTOR_FIRST_NAME
PROFILE_EXTRACTOR_LAST_NAME
PROFILE_EXTRACTOR_MAIL
PROFILE_EXTRACTOR_DISPLAY_NAME
```

---

### Enrichment

In order to incorporate enrichment to the user profile recieved from the saml-idp you need to edit the "authConfig.js" file and write a function to replace the "enrich" function.

default function is an identity function:

```
enrich: x=>x;
```

enrich can be a sync/async function and will allways be dealt with "await".

---

### SAML-Response Manipulation

If usage of the SAML IDP SAMLResponse is needed ( ie. ADFS SAMLRespone Form Data in HTML POST):

Send initial request to /setCallback with param 'useADFS=true'.

If useADFS is sent adfs-proxy-shraga will return the SAMLResponse to given callbackURL.

---

#### If using passport-saml

if using [passport-saml](https://github.com/bergie/passport-saml) make sure to set {entryPoint} to be:

```
const entryPoint = `${ADFS-PROXY-URL}/setCallback/${encodeURIComponent(SAML_CALLBACK_URL)}?useADFS=true`
```

---

#### Manipulating SAML Claims

SAML Claims can be changed before being sent back to client ( callbackURL ).

in authConfig: configure `samlResponseModifier`

`samlResponseModifier` is a map of Claim names to Manipulation Functions.

For Example:

```
  samlResponseModifier: {
    "uid": async (originalValue) => originalValue,
    "email": async (originalValue) => "not Original value"
  }
```

---

### Run Server:

```
run: npm start
```

---

## Optional Params

---

`SignInSecret`: When using Shraga as a jwt IDP then SignInSecret is a MUST HAVE parameter. This is a base64 encoded secret to sign jwt object with.

`useEnrichId`: When using Shraga as a jwt IDP then if 'useEnrichId' is truthy then the 'id' property of the user profile will be changed to the id recieved from the 'enrich' function. ( useEnrichId value will be sent to enrich function - behaviour is decided by the function ).

---

`useADFS`: If useADFS is truthy then Shraga will return the SAMLReponse ( modified by Shraga - explanation above ) directly to 'callbackUrl'. jwt will not be used.

`RelayState`: RelayState value will be added to SAMLResponse Form Data if useADFS is truthy and be added to jwtBody otherwise. if RelayState is undefined value will not be added at all.

---

## Application Implementation

---

### passport-shraga

[passport-shraga](https://github.com/ShragaUser/passport-shraga) is a [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) authentication strategy that utilizes Shraga as an saml-idp proxy.

it is also availabe as an npm module and can ve installed using:

```
npm i --save passport-shraga
```

---

### passport.js

usage of passport-shraga is as followed:

```
const passport = require("passport");
const { Strategy } = require("passport-shraga");

passport.serializeUser((user, cb) => {
    //serialize function
});

passport.deserializeUser((id, cb) => {
    ///deserialize function
});

passport.use(new Strategy({}, (profile, done) => {
    console.log(`My Profile Is: ${profile}`);
    done(null, profile);
}))
```

---

### Log out

must do frontend redirect, can be something like: "windows.location = <SOME_ROUTE>" at your frontend, in order to pass the request with the cookies.
example:

```
window.location = '/logout';
```

and then your backend should look like this:

```
router.get('/logout', (req, res, next) => {
    res.redirect(SHRAGA_URL + '/logout?callbackURL=' + callbackURL);
})
```

---

### shraga-example

[shraga-example](https://github.com/ShragaUser/shraga-example) is an End-2-End implementation of an express.js app using [passport-shraga](https://github.com/ShragaUser/passport-shraga) to authenticate users via Shraga (adfs-proxy).

It can be used as a reference point for configuring an app to use Shraga.
